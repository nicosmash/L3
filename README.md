## ðŸ“¢ Virtual Lab : Labs

* **Download the latest version of VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads**
    * If you want you can use other virtualization tools like VMware Fusion, VMware Player, VMware Workstation, etc. but without assurance that everything works. 
Many tests were carried out on VirtualBox.

* **Download the latest version of Kali: https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines**
    * username: **kali**
    * password: **kali**
    * I recommand you a "NAT Network" for all VM labs and Kali machines with a specific name and a specific IP range. 
    * To change QWERTY in AZERTY you can use "setxkbmap fr" (volatile config) or "sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration" (non-volatile config).

* **Easy** :
    * **VM_207: https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/rickdiculouslyeasy-1,207/**
        - [+] Targets: Find target IP address, list all open ports, services and version, find 8 vulnerabilities flags beginning by "FLAG{"
        - [+] For each flag found, write on your report "FLAG_x :" and explain how did you find it.
* **Medium** :      
    * **VM_216: https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/basic-pentesting-1,216/**
